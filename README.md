DURATION: 8 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

In this task, I designed a simple and practical framework to make big data systems more secure and compliant with data protection laws like GDPR (for personal data in Europe) and HIPAA (for healthcare data in the US). The goal was to ensure that sensitive information is collected, stored, and processed safely.

The framework has six main parts:

Data Ingestion – Collect data securely using encryption and only take what’s necessary.

Data Storage – Store data in encrypted form and control access using user roles.

Data Processing – Mask or anonymize personal data and process it in secure environments.

Access Management – Use multi-factor authentication and limit data access based on roles.

Monitoring & Auditing – Track who accesses the data and save logs for future checks.

Compliance Automation – Handle user requests (like data deletion) automatically and generate compliance reports.

I also included an example of a healthcare company using AWS and Spark to securely process patient data. Through this task, I learned how important it is to not just work with data, but to protect it and follow privacy laws.
